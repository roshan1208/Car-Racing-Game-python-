In this project i have create 2-D Car Racing Game which personally i used to play in my childhood days
idea is simple a Turtle want to cross the multi lan Road and now its your responsibility to help turtle by pressing
Up, Down, Left, Right arrow key to cross the road....(From Starting point to End point)
every time Turtle reach the end point... Game will level up and car speed will increase ...
..

step to follow:
1.> Open "Car Racing Game" Folder to pycharm, vscode or spyder IDE (i personally use Pycharm)
2.First verify in your interpreter "turtle library" is install or not? (If not then install turtle library)
3.> Run main.py file
